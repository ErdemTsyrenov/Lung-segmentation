# Lung-segmentation
Deep learning approach for lung segmentation.
In this project we used dataset from Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilpandey360/chest-xray-masks-and-labels
We implemented 2 neural networks: simple convolutional model was used in lungsegmentation.ipynb, and U-Net model was used in lungsegmentation_UNet.ipynb. Both models were tested using dice coefficient. Dice for U-Net model is 0,96.
